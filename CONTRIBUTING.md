## Setup

Before compiling, make sure to install the dependencies by running `npm i` in the root of this repository. Doing so will also install dependencies for all workspaces.

## Compilation

Within the `extension` directory, you can run `npm run dev` to start up a development server with the web version, which should automatically open in your browser. Alternatively, run `npm run build:web` to compile the static files for the web version, which will output to the `dist/web` directory.
