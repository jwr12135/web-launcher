# Data Settings

These settings let you manage the data and configurations Web Launcher stores for you. To get here, in the settings, click on the "Data" button in the navigation.

## Backup

This option lets you backup your data into a configuration file which is then downloaded.

## Restore

This option lets you restore your data from a previous backup, replacing your current data. It is suggested to not upload a corrupted or modified configuration file unless you know what your doing. See [here](https://github.com/web-launcher/web-launcher/blob/master/src/types/declarations.d.ts) for the TypeScript interface of the configuration.

## Reset

This option lets you reset your data, changing it back to the default state. If you need to reset your data but can not access this option, delete then reinstall the extension, if your using the demo, clear the local storage.
